# Traffic-Prediction
* This project presents an innovative Traffic Prediction System that integrates historical traffic data, weather information, and real-time social media sentiment analysis to deliver precise and actionable traffic predictions.
* By combining quantitative and qualitative data sources, including structured traffic and weather datasets and unstructured social media feeds, the system aims to provide holistic insights into urban traffic patterns.
* The project employs advanced machine learning algorithms, including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for time-series analysis and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks, to model and predict traffic conditions with high accuracy. A sentiment analysis module processes real-time Twitter data using pre-trained NLP models to gauge public sentiment about traffic and weather-related events.

Users can:
* Traffic flow visualization using congestion prediction on heat map. 
* Gives current weather conditions.
* Gives future traffic flow prediction.
* Provides possible route for destination.
* Indicates road blocks and the reasoning.

Admin can additionally:
* Can Manually control road blocks with image and discription.

Installation:
* Create Fire Base server for authentication.
* The main code of the project can be accessed by predictappcategorisewithmetrics.py
